game description

This program allows two people to play a game of “tic-tac-toe”, with the
computer acting as a “referee.” Here is what the program might look like in action:
Welcome! Tic-Tac-Toe is a two player game.
Enter player one's name: Foo
Enter player two's name: Bar
Players take turns marking a square. Only squares
not already marked can be picked. Once a player has
marked three squares in a row, he or she wins! If all squares
are marked and no three squares are the same, a tied game is declared.
Have Fun!
